# RankingApp
A react front end, using C#

Very simple movie and album ranking app.

React.js front end with a C# backend.
Fully implemented.

TODOs:
1 - Clean up code where possible.
2 - Add backend db to save films/ albums
3 - Alternatively to 2, implement an API that can webscrap movie names + images / album names + images.
